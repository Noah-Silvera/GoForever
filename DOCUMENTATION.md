## Documentation

In general, follow the [js doc guidelines](http://usejsdoc.org/about-getting-started.html) to write your documentation. 

* This allows for microsoft intellisense to insert hints inline on the functionality

* This allows for documentation to be generated automatically

Use your judgement for what should be documented, but some general guidelines

* Any exposed interface should be very well documented

* Any complex control flow or algorithm should be documented for later debugging

* Writing test cases in the BDD style should be self documenting. Make sure the title of the individual tests accurately reflects what is being tested
